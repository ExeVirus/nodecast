This interview between myself (ExeVirus) and Mr. 56Independent, is a chance for the Minetest Community to meet one of our newer members. Enjoy!

### Mr. 56 Independent Bio
_____________________________

- Name was completely arbitrary, via Gmail's auto-generated name of "506_independent"
- System Admin Programmer, still in school
- Has a physical server at home, uses it mostly for Minetest Hosting
- Loves the [Advanced Trains Mod: 'advtrains'](https://content.minetest.net/packages/orwell/advtrains/)
- Loves Worldbuilding just so he can host a [cool wiki](http://56i.duckdns.org/dokuwiki/doku.php)


### Runs a Server 
_______________________

- [56I.server](mtserver.56i.duckdns.org)
- State of the art travel infrastructure
- Slow load time, be patient ;)
- Desire for more players, give it a try
- [Online Map](56i.duckdns.org:8080)
- Don't forget the [wiki](http://56i.duckdns.org/dokuwiki/doku.php)
- Very organized, very different than other maps in that sense
- Wants an IntelliJ IDE fork for Minetest Modding

### Advanced Trains
_______________________

- "Advanced Trains is Brilliant"
- Tracks have longer, gentler curves, and huge trains much larger than a single node
- Interlocking Cars, and wider tracks
- "I love it because it's full of Trains"
- Much more realistic than normal minecarts
