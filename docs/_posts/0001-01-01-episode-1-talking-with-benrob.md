This first Minetest episode is a fun interview between myself (ExeVirus) and Benrob0329, covering a wide range of topics, but especially hitting on how to start your own projects within the minetest community. 

### Benrob Bio
_____________________________

Self taught, does a lot of programming things. Likes open world and story driven games, such as Subnautica, Minecraft, and Valve Titles. Stumbled across Minetest via the Linux Mint repositories back in ~2012. Left and came back to Minetest back in ~2015. Enjoys the redstone-esque mod [Mesecons](https://content.minetest.net/packages/Jeija/mesecons/), and feels most connected with the Minetest Community of all communities he is a member of. 

* Creator of [The Infinite IKEA](https://content.minetest.net/packages/benrob0329/ikea/) game for Minetest Engine. 

* Favorite "Mod" (Game) [Nodecore](https://content.minetest.net/packages/Warr1024/nodecore/)

### Opinions on Minetest
_______________________

- Nothing to complain about
- I (Benrob) tend to stay within the engine limitations on purpose
- No good shaders/shader pipeline yet.
- Dislikes that the community hates Minecraft, even though it inspires a lot of Minetest development.
- Hopes that Minetest continues "down the path of being an engine and content distribution platform"
- Request for a standardized, official Minetest code formatting config tool for lua

### How to make Minetest Content
_______________________

- People want more longer-term series (let's plays, this podcast, etc)
- Interactive content is great, as in story or engaging content
- People in this community "are generally busy", so "be patient with people"
- Establish yourself first (especially as a modder), before reaching out and trying to collaborate with someone more prominent in the commmunity. 
- Continue to experiment, even after you start
- This is a great community for starting out
- If you are brand new to programming, and want to be a modder, start with a basic lua tutorial online.
- Not everyone has to be a programmer, there is great need for players, artists, creators, story writers, musicians, *bug reporters*, etc. **Contribute how you are able!**
- Have fun, and try different things, especially different games.
